# **PANDAS-CHALLENGE**

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file that explores various aspects of school performance based on the provided data.

## Analyses

1. **Local Government Area Summary**
2. **School Summary**
3. **Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)**
4. **Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)**
5. **Math Scores by Year by School**
6. **Reading Scores by Year by School**
7. **Scores by School Spending**
8. **Scores by School Size**
9. **Scores by School Type**

## School Performance Analysis

### School Type Analysis

Independent schools shows a slightly higher average scores and passing rates.

### Average Math Scores by Year

While most schools maintain consistent math scores, Holden High School's significant spike in Year 10 seems to stand out.

### Average Reading Scores by Year

Most reading scores are consistent, with an average within 2 points throughout the dataset when looking at a year-on-year comparison.

### Spending Ranges (Per Student) Analysis

Schools within the <$585 spending range showed the best results.

### School Size Analysis

Smaller schools shine with higher scores and passing rates.

### School Type Analysis

Independent schools maintain their lead in academic performance, with higher average scores and passing rates.

## Conclusions

1. The Spending Ranges (Per Student) Analysis indicates that schools within the <$585 spending range consistently demonstrate the best academic performance. This suggests that a more strategic and effective allocation of resources, rather than simply increasing budgets, contributes significantly to improved student outcomes.

2. The School Size Analysis highlights the success of smaller schools, which tend to shine with higher scores and passing rates. This implies that a more intimate and focused learning environment, characteristic of smaller schools, contributes positively to academic achievement.
